## how to become a committer

Anyone being supportive of the community and working in any of the CoPDoC areas can become an Apache Uniffle committer.
The CoPDoC is an acronym from ASF to describe how we recognize your contributions not only by code.

To attract new contributors, we regularly host open source contributor meeting, offer a mentorship program,
and actively respond to every message on PRs to foster an environment that welcomes and supports newcomers.

- Community - You can join us via our mailing list, issue trackers, discussions page to interact with community members, and share vision and knowledge
- Project - a clear vision and consensus are needed
- Documentation - without it, the stuff remains only in the minds of the authors
- Code - discussion goes nowhere without code
