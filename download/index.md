Choose a source distribution in either *tar* or *zip* format,
and [verify](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi#verify)
using the corresponding *pgp* signature (using the committer file in
[KEYS](https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/uniffle/KEYS)).
If you cannot do that, the *sha512* hash file may be used to check that the
download has completed OK.

For fast downloads, current source distributions are hosted on
[mirror servers](https://dlcdn.apache.org/incubator/uniffle/);
older source distributions are in the
[archive](https://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/uniffle/).
